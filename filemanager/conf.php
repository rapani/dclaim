   You can permit user to upload images but not other type for security reason.
   You can add .htaccess file to prevent user executing PHP scripts but its location is not on {$cfg->rootdir}
   
   For example:
   Your root document of your system is
   /home/youname/public_html
   
   You set upload directory to
   /home/yourname/public_html/upload
   
   You can place an .htaccess file in
   /home/youname/public_html
   to redirect client access
